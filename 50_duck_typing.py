# 50 (04:23:20â€‹) duck typing ðŸ¦†

""" 
    duck typing = concept where the class of an object is less 
    important that the methods/attributes that the class may have
    
    The class type is NOT checked if the minimum methods/attributes are present

    Based of popular phrase:
    "If walks like a duck, and it quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck"

    Summary:
    * minimum attributes & methods > class type

        # So any object passed in that implements the methods used below
        # (walk & talk) will work
        duck.walk()
        duck.talk()

        # duck.swim() will cause an error when we pass in a chicken object
        # because it does not implement the swim() method

# Successfully catches a chicken with method written to catch a duck
# NOTE: this still works because chicken implements the same methods as duck
# and as a result, a chicken can be substituted for a duck
person.catch(chicken)
